# Clone This Repo!

This is the repo to clone for the code review module.

You'll notice that it's a solution for the Animals exercise you may have previously encountered on your travels. I know it's mine, so if you've found this before you do the exercise, don't cheat! ^_^

You need to clone this down, then make a change or two, then open up a Pull Request so that your Trainer can see it.

Once you're done, try making Pull Requests on someone else's repos in your cohort. (Ask permission first!)
